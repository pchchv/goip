// IPv4Address is an IPv4 address, or a subnet of multiple IPv4 addresses.
// An IPv4 address is composed of 4 1-byte segments and can optionally have an associated prefix length.
// Each segment can represent a single value or a range of values.
// The zero value is "0.0.0.0".
//
// To construct one from a string, use NewIPAddressString, then use the ToAddress or GetAddress method of [IPAddressString],
// and then use ToIPv4 to get an IPv4Address, assuming the string had an IPv4 format.
//
// For other inputs, use one of the multiple constructor functions like NewIPv4Address.
// You can also use one of the multiple constructors for [IPAddress] like NewIPAddress and then convert using ToIPv4.
