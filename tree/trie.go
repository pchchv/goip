// BinTrie is a binary trie.
//
// To use BinTrie, your keys implement TrieKey.
//
// All keys are either fixed, in which the key value does not change,
// or comprising of a prefix in which an initial sequence of bits does not change, and the the remaining bits represent all bit values.
// The length of the initial fixed sequence of bits is the prefix length.
// The total bit length is the same for all keys.
//
// A key with a prefix is also known as a prefix block, and represents all bit sequences with the same prefix.
//
// The zero value for BinTrie is a binary trie ready for use.
//
// Each node can be associated with a value, making BinTrie an associative binary trie.
// If you do not wish to associate values to nodes, then use the type EmptyValueType,
// in which case the value will be ignored in functions that print node strings.
